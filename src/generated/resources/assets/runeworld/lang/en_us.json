  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.mosquito.text2": "When killed, the mosquito has a chance to drop a bundle of mosquito eggs.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.text1": "The blood world is a grim and hostile world. In a perpetuate dusk, the light is always dim, only the faintest light coming from the dark sun.
