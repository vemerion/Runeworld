  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood.text1": "Instead of water, blood is the fluid that can be found on the surface of the blood world. In many ways, it functions similar to water, for example, you can scoop it up in a bucket. On the other hand, blood has a lot of unique mechanics, detailed below:",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood.text2": "You can drink for the blood bucket, similar to milk. This can be used as a cure to the dangerous blood drained sickness that some enemies inflict.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood.text3": "If you throw any type of rune into a large enough blood pool, after a while, some of the blood will be consumed, and the rune will be converted into a blood rune.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood.text4": "Blood can be used to speed up the growth of nearby crops, but after a while, the blood will be converted into normal water.",

  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood_crystallite.text1": "A Blood Crystallite is a rare and valuable item. It can be found in hidden blood bat lairs, which look like large hills to the untrained eye, but are hollow and the home to flocks of blood bats.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood_crystallite.text2": "You might think it safe to snatch the crystallite while the bats are sleeping, but be careful! Blood bats can smell nearby players carrying blood crystallites, and will wake up to attack!",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood_crystallite.text3": "If you manage to escape a blood bat lair with a crystallite, you should consider yourself lucky, for the crystallite has several uses.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood_crystallite.text4": "The blood can be washed of the crystallite in a cauldron, revealing a diamond underneath.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.blood_crystallite.text5": "It can be used to craft a blood translocator item, which functions like a portable rune portal to and from the blood world. Unfortunately, it is consumed after it is used once.",

  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_bat": "Blood Bat",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_bat.text1": "The blood bat is a large and dangerous monster. They spend most of their time sleeping upside down in giant dead trees or hidden lairs, but if awakened, they will attack! When they bite their long teeth into the flesh of their target, they have a chance to apply the dangerous blood drained disease.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_bat.text2": "When killed, the blood bat has a chance to drop a tooth, which can be used as a weapon that applies the blood drained disease.",

  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_gorilla.text1": "The blood gorilla is a menacing type of ape, towering above most other creatures. They reside on giant thrones found throughout the blood world, and will remain calm unless provoked. Adventurers should be prepared before picking a fight with a blood gorilla, since they are both very resilient and hard-hitting.",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_gorilla.text2": "When killed, they drop their crown, which when worn, will allow the player to 'open their eyes'.",

  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_monkey.text1": "The blood monkey is an annoying creature. They balance on top of large blood pillars, out of reach, and throw pebbles at you! And if you knock them down, they will come running at you!",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.blood_monkey.text2": "When killed, they drop their pesky blood pebbles. They can be used to skip stones. Fun!",

  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.tick": "Tick",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.mobs.tick.text1": "The tick is a mob that can sometimes be found attached to blood monkeys. They leech blood when attacking (or when their host is hurt), and will grow in size. The bigger they grow, the more unstable they get, and the likelier they are to explode, damaging everyone around them!",
  "guide.runeworld.blood_world.text1": "The blood world is a grim and hostile world. In a perpetuate dusk, the light is always dim, only the faintest light coming from the dark sun. Giant mosquitoes buzzing around the many blood pools, and Blood Bats hanging upside down from large dead trees. Why would you want to travel there?",

  "guide.runeworld.fire_world.fire_ritual.text1": "The fire ritual is a structure that can be founds while exploring the fire world. It is made up of a single pillar of a rare type of stone, which will at random intervals convert certain blocks placed adjacent to the pillar.",
  "guide.runeworld.fire_world.fire_ritual.text2": "Another, forbidden and dangerous ritual exists. A blood crystallite can be used to coat a single fire ritual block with blood. If four fire ritual blocks are coated in blood, a terrible and deadly creature will spawn! But beware, as this will permanently destroy the ritual pillar...",
  "guide.runeworld.fire_world.text1": "The fire world is, to no one's surprise, a very warm place. Instead of water, there is lava. Instead of grass, there is fire. But for adventurers brave enough to enter, there is also valuable treasures!",

  "guide.runeworld.portal.text2": "The rules for the portal size and shape are less strict than for nether portals. See below images for a couple of examples.",
  "guide.runeworld.portal.text3": "But beware, for unlike the nether portal, no portal is generated on the other side when you enter! Be sure to bring extra obsidian and runes, to make sure that you are not stuck in a rune world forever!",
